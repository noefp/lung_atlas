<h3>Conditions related with age</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Young: Lungs from young mice (8-12 weeks old)</li>
    <li>Old: Lungs from old mice (2 years old</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Conditions related with treatments</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Control: Mice treated with PBS intranasally administered.</li>
    <li>4PBA: Mice treated with 200 mg/Kg of Sodium 4-phenylbutirate diluted in PBS administered intraperitoneally at 0, 6 and 8 hours.</li>
    <li>LPS: Mice treated with 2 mg/Kg of Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from E. coli O111:B4 (L2630, Sigma) diluted in PBS intranasally administered in 50 µL of total volume (≈ 50 µg by animal).</li>
    <li>LPS-4PBA: Mice treated with both, LPS and after with 4PBA according the protocols described.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>
    This dataset was generated by our group.
    <br> 
    This dataset was published by <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1054962" target="_blank">Rico-Llanos G et al., 2022</a> 
    and raw data can be found in the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD037978" target="_blank">PRIDE PXD037978</a>.

    Experimental procedure: 
    <br> 
    Mice lungs (n=4 for every treatment group) were mechanically broken up with a mortar and pestle and sonicated for 30 minutes in RIPA buffer to obtain protein extracts. After quantification by BCA method, volumes were adjusted to equalize all concentrations (One sample of the group “LPS” was excluded at this level by abnormally low values). The carried-out protocol was previously described in detail90 and adapted for lung tissue. Briefly, proteins were stacked in an acrylamide gel, bands were cut and further treated to be reduced with DTT, carbamidomethylated and digested with trypsin overnight. Then, resulting peptides were extracted, purified and concentrated for next steps and posterior mass spectrometric analysis. Peptides samples were separated by liquid chromatography in Easy nLC 1200 UHPLC system coupled to a spectrometer coupled to a hybrid quadrupole-linear trap-Orbitrap Q-Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer for the analysis. Protein identification was performed, against the Mus musculus protein database of the SwissProt. Raw acquired data were analyzed on the Proteome Discoverer 2.4 platform (all by Thermo Fisher Scientific). Label-free quantification was implemented using the Minora function, setting the following parameters: maximum alignment retention time of 10 min with a minimum signal/noise of 5 for feature linkage mapping.
